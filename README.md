# Project-Euler
A repositry to keep all my project euler solution files in one place

Most of this repositry has been compiled retrospectively, hence the lack in completeness for the beginning problems. Almost all codie is written in pythonas this is the easiest for project euler, coding style and commenting is sub parr for the rest of my code as these sdcripts were a means to and end of solving the puzzles.
